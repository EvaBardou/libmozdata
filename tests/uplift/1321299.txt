Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Bug 1114580
[User impact if declined]: Some sites won't work.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Not yet.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Verifying that this
   fixes the SalesForce site would be good.  I don't have steps to reproduce,
   but maybe Jessilyn does.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None.
[Is the change risky?]: Slightly.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: Changes web-visible behavior.  That said,
   the new behavior is one that other browsers (e.g. Chrome) already ship and
   is the one we had decided on a while ago to avoid breaking sites.  The real
   question is whether this is more or less risky than backing out bug 1114580.
   I suspect it's less risky.
[String changes made/needed]: None.
