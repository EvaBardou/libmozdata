The fix

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Bug 1274516
[User impact if declined]: The browser tries to access a delegate of the content process. Probably crash like bug 1280150.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: Tested locally. Autotests on try pending.
[Risks and why]: Pretty low. This is a small change to fix a regression, and we carefully move the pointer along the list data structure using the condition and try not to introduce more regressions.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None.
