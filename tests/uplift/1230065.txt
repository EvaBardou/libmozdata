Approval Request Comment for 46
[Feature/regressing bug #]:
Changes from bug 1198613 make a long standing bug much more obvious.
[User impact if declined]: hard to read text in selects, sometimes requiring clicking on the select to see the current value.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
There are a number of existing tests for selects, but they do not cover this case.  There is no new test because the patch is more of a workaround than a fixing, merely mitigating the effect of the bug in comment situations.
[Risks and why]: The patch is reasonably simple, but there is risk of larger than expected select buttons.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: none.
